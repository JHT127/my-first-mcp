# Test Plan — Job Application Tracker MCP (Week 5)

**Tools covered:** `add_application`, `list_applications`, `update_status`, `get_next_actions`
**Test environment:** MCP Inspector, local `./data/applications.json`
**Happy-path inputs:** reused from `examples/*.json`
**Screenshot evidence:** numbered screenshots refer to the attached evidence document (`Doc1.docx`, images 1–14)

## 5.1 + 5.2 — Test Plan & Execution

| id | tool | setup | input | expected | result | evidence |
|----|------|-------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| TC-01 | add_application | Inspector connected, current fixture in `./data/applications.json` unchanged | `examples/add_application.json` → `{company:"Google", role:"Frontend Developer", date_applied:"2026-07-30", status:"applied", source:"linkedin", notes:"Applied through LinkedIn."}` | "Application added successfully." + new record added with a new `id` | PASS | Screenshot 1 — record `app-003` created successfully |
| TC-02 | add_application | Same setup | Same as `examples/add_application.json` but `date_applied` changed to an invalid format: `"30-07-2026"` | Zod rejects before the handler runs, with a date-format validation error | PASS | Screenshot 2 — Zod rejects invalid date with pattern validation error |
| TC-03 | list_applications | Fixture contains at least one application with status "applied" | `examples/list_applications.json` → `{status:"applied"}` | Returns only matching applications, with `total` and `truncated:false` | PASS | Screenshot 3 shows initial run **FAIL** (response missing `total`/`truncated`, contradicting SECURITY.md spec) — fixed in `listApplications.ts` (commit `7a9ddcd`, added CAP=50 + `total`/`truncated`) — Screenshot 4 shows re-run **PASS** with `total:2, truncated:false` |
| TC-04 | list_applications | Same setup | Same shape as `examples/list_applications.json` but `status` changed to a value not in the enum: `{status:"pending"}` | Zod rejects before the handler runs, with a clear enum validation error | PASS | Screenshot 5 — tested via Inspector CLI (`--tool-arg status=pending`) since the GUI dropdown only allows valid enum values; rejected with "Invalid option: expected one of applied\|interview\|offer\|rejected\|no_response" |
| TC-05 | update_status | `examples/update_status.json` uses `id:"123-off"`, which is not a real fixture id — ran instead against an existing id (`app-001`). Back up the fixture first: `cp data/applications.json data/applications.backup.json` | `{id:"app-001", new_status:"offer"}` | Returns the updated application as JSON with its `status` changed to `"offer"` | PASS | Screenshot 6 — `app-001` status updated from "applied" to "offer" |
| TC-06 | update_status | Same setup; restore original fixture after TC-05 if needed: `cp data/applications.backup.json data/applications.json` | `{id:"app-999"}` (id does not exist) | Clear, short error: `"No application found with id: app-999"` — no stack trace | PASS | Screenshot 7 — clear error returned, no internal details exposed |
| TC-07 | update_status | Same setup | `{id:""}` (empty) | Zod rejects: `"id: Too small: expected string to have >=1 characters"` | PASS | Screenshot 8 — Zod rejects empty id as expected |
| TC-08 | get_next_actions | Fixture contains a recently-updated / stale application | `examples/get_next_actions.json` → `{limit:3, status:"applied"}` | Returns one or more actions with a clear reason, correct `total`/`truncated` | PASS | Initial run **FAIL** (response was a raw array with no `total`/`truncated`, contradicting SECURITY.md spec) — fixed in `getNextActions.ts` (commit `6cb4904`, added `total`/`truncated` + defensive `effectiveLimit` clamp) — Screenshot 10 shows re-run **PASS** with `total:1, truncated:false` |
| TC-09 | get_next_actions | Same setup | `{limit:0}` | Invalid input — Zod rejects because `limit` must be a positive integer (0 not allowed) | PASS | Screenshot 11 — rejected with "limit: Too small: expected number to be >0" |
| TC-10 | get_next_actions | Same setup | `{limit:50}` (above the max allowed of 10) | Schema currently allows the value through; handler applies a defensive clamp (`Math.min(Math.max(1, limit), 10)`) so the effective limit never exceeds 10 — no unsafe or unbounded response | PASS | Screenshot 12 — `limit:50` accepted, safely clamped by handler, `total:1, truncated:false` (matches actual application count, well under the cap) |
| TC-11 | list_applications | Back up the fixture: `cp data/applications.json data/applications.backup.json`, then temporarily replace it with an empty array `[]` | `{}` (no filter) | Valid empty-data state (not an error): `applications: [], total:0, truncated:false` | PASS | Screenshot 13 — empty fixture returns valid empty state, not an error |
| TC-12 | list_applications | Back up the fixture, then temporarily rename `data/applications.json` to simulate an unavailable/offline local data source | `{}` | Returns the short generic error `"Could not read applications data."` without a stack trace or internal details | PASS | Screenshot 14 — generic error returned to caller; internal stack trace only logged server-side via `console.error`, never exposed to the model |

**Fixture reset notes:**
- TC-05 modifies an existing application's status — fixture was backed up before and can be restored from `data/applications.backup.json` if later tests depend on the original state.
- TC-11 and TC-12 replace/hide the data file entirely — `data/applications.json` was restored to its original state after each one before continuing.

**Fixes applied during 5.2 (documented per "on a FAIL: fix, re-run, note the commit"):**
- `commit 7a9ddcd` — `list_applications` was missing `total`/`truncated` fields required by SECURITY.md; added a 50-record cap plus both fields.
- `commit 6cb4904` — `get_next_actions` was missing `total`/`truncated` fields and had no defensive limit clamp; added both plus `effectiveLimit = Math.min(Math.max(1, limit), 10)`.
