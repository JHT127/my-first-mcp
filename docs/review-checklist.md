## Review Session
Live testing session via MCP Inspector (job-application-tracker server),
conducted with Shahd Raed, Razan Froukh, Taima Nazzal , Joud Thaher and Dareen Abualhaj — 8/13/2026
(Google Meet, screenshot attached with submission).

## Tool-Level Testing Notes

Tested live via MCP Inspector with Dareen Abualhaj, 8/13/2026
(Google Meet session with Shahd Raed and Razan Froukh also present).

### 1. add_application
- Valid input: company: "Exalt Technologies", role: "Backend",
  date_applied: "2026-08-10", status: "applied", source: "cold_apply"
  → "Application added successfully." New record created with id: "app-004"
- Invalid input: date_applied in wrong format (not YYYY-MM-DD)
  → Tool Error: "Invalid arguments for tool add_application: date_applied:
  Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format." (rejected by Zod before handler runs)

### 2. list_applications
- Valid input: statusFilter: "applied"
  → Returned 1 matching application (app-003, Exalt Technologies),
  total: 1, truncated: false

### 3. update_status
- Valid input: id: "app-003", status: "offer"
  → Application updated successfully, status field changed to "offer"
- Invalid input: id: "app-005" (non-existent)
  → Error: "No application found with id: app-005"
- Invalid input: id: "" (empty string)
  → Tool Error: "Invalid arguments for tool update_status: id: Too small:
  expected string to have >=1 characters"

### 4. get_next_actions
- Valid input: statusFilter: "offer", limit: 3
  → Returned action: "Follow up with Exalt Technologies" (app-003),
  reason: stale application, 741 days without an update

## Peer Review Feedback (from Dareen)
Overall the P0 tools are working correctly with no critical issues found.
Main recommendations:
- Update README so a new user with no prior knowledge can clone, set up,
  and run the project (setup steps, dependencies, env variables, usage).
- Update application sorting to sort by `date_applied` instead of
  insertion order.
- Confirm `.env` is excluded via `.gitignore` and no secrets are exposed
  in the repository.

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Improve README setup and usage instructions | All members | End of Week 4 | Completed |
| Sort applications by date_applied | Razan | End of Week 4 | Completed |
| Reconfirm .env exclusion and no secrets in repo | All members | End of Week 4 | Completed |

## Security Verification
- [x] `.env` excluded via `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.local` excluded via `.gitignore`
